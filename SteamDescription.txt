[b]✅ Highlights[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Live Quality Odds[/b] - Pick a pawn + recipe (or a constructor on blueprints/frames) and see full [i]Awful → Legendary[/i] odds. Includes boosts: [i]Inspired Creativity (+2)[/i] and [i]Production Specialist (+1)[/i]. Caps handled correctly.
[*][b]Quality Log (Table & Log views)[/b] - Searchable, filterable history of every roll. Sort columns, resize with drag splitters, and choose which columns to show. Responsive header/footer with “⋯ More” so nothing overlaps.
[*][b]Materials-aware search[/b] - Matches Stuff [i]and[/i] per-ingredient materials for multi-mat recipes [i]and[/i] extra construction ingredients (like Components). Shows icons when available.
[*][b]Construction ingredient tracking[/b] - Log entries for built structures include all extra ingredients actually consumed.
[*][b]Right-click row actions[/b] - Copy friendly/raw rows, copy defNames, or [b]Delete row[/b] (hold [i]Shift[/i] to skip confirmation).
[*][b]Time columns[/b] - In-game time ago [i]and[/i] real-life play time since the entry (no per-row timers; uses a single accumulator).
[*][b]CSV export[/b] - Includes PlayTime + Materials, with an “Open folder” button and auto-prune by count/size.
[/list]

[b]🎯 Optional (Safe) Dev Cheat[/b]
Turn on a threshold slider that says: [i]“Always roll at least the highest tier whose probability ≥ X%.”[/i]
[list]
[*]Never biases the odds UI (cheat is force-disabled during sampling).
[*]Respects Legendary rules: you still need legal access (inspiration/role) to reach it.
[*]Implemented as a safe single-hop bump via vanilla quality set. Reentrancy-guarded.
[/list]

[b]🧠 Accuracy & Performance[/b]
[list]
[*]Odds sample the real vanilla roll via Harmony; results are cached per (pawn, recipe/builtDef, boosts, cheat flag) for snappy UI.
[*]RL time is cheap (single accumulator while unpaused). No ticking per-row timers.
[*]Dev-only “Validate 100k” compares large-N samples vs the UI and copies details to your clipboard.
[/list]

[b]🛠 Controls (Quick Ref)[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Ctrl/Cmd+F[/b] focuses search; click the [b]×[/b] in the box to clear.
[*]Right-click a row for copy tools or [b]Delete[/b] (hold [i]Shift[/i] to skip confirm).
[*]Pop out/Dock toggle switches between floating and tabbed views.
[*]Use the [b]Columns[/b] menu to show/hide columns; [b]Reset widths[/b] anytime.
[/list]

[b]🧩 Compatibility[/b]
[list]
[*]RimWorld 1.6 (also expected to work on 1.4 / 1.5).
[*]Plays well with most quality-altering mods because we sample the [i]actual[/i] roll.
[*]Construction quality attribution handles minified furniture correctly.
[/list]

[b]🔔 Optional Notification Silencing[/b]
Tired of spam? You can silence Masterwork/Legendary toasts and Letters for the exact crafted/built item.

[b]🧪 Diagnostics (Dev Mode)[/b]
Turn on QI debug logs for rich `[QI]` traces. “Validate 100k” copies its report to your clipboard.
