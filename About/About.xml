    Quality log + live quality odds + optional dev cheat (≥ configurable threshold).

    • Quality Log (Table View)
      – New resizable, sortable table with zebra striping & hover highlight.
      – Drag splitters to resize columns; layout persists in Mod Settings.
      – Dynamic last column auto-fills remaining space.
      – Search box + dropdown filters (quality tier, skill).
      – Materials/Stuff column shows icons + full tooltip; CSV export button.
      – Duplicate suppression prevents multiple entries for the same item.

    • Live Quality Odds Gizmo
      – Appears on work tables; pick a pawn & recipe to see full tier odds (Awful → Legendary).
      – Uses the game’s actual roll function for accurate, mod-friendly probabilities.
      – Correctly resolves skill (Construction/Artistic/Crafting or recipe.workSkill).
      – Handles inspirations and roles (Inspired Creativity, Production Specialist).

    • Construction Path Support
      – Binds frame → completed thing; attributes builder pawn and Construction skill.
      – Handles minified furniture.

    • Optional Dev Cheat
      – Forces final quality ≥ the lowest tier with chance ≥ threshold.
      – Legendary still requires a legal bump (Inspiration/Production Specialist).

    • UX & Performance
      – “Settings” button in the log window footer jumps straight to mod settings.
      – Smooth scrolling and lightweight rendering; recalculations only when inputs change.
